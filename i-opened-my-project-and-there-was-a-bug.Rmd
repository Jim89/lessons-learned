![who](www/who.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Started at KPMG in 2012
    * Where I met Enda
* Early career as a data analyst/junior data scientist
* Self study, then MSc Data Science - including a placement at Sains
* Worked on a variety of problems
    * ML, non-ML, calculations, remediations, forensics
* An admission, I won't be talking much about bugs    
* CAUTION: Mostly stupid pictures and gifs
</aside>

# Some basic principles

## Meet your customer

![meeting](www/meeting.png)

<aside class = "notes">
* If you don't know who that is - find out!
* Obviously they're too happy to be in a meeting
* BUT - meeting your customer/end user is crucial
* Ideally face-to-face
* Make it regular, keep them involved
* Solicit feedback early, and often
* Discuss the odd things you see
* Resolve issues
</aside>

## Do some analysis

![analysis](www/analysis.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Understand the issue, understand the data
* Is the issue noteworthy?
* What are the (sub)populations
* Size your data = size the problem
* Let's you talk about the impact of your work
</aside>

## {data-background="www/solve-problem.jpg"}

<aside class="notes">
* Focus your efforts on things that solve the customer's problem
* If it's not helping you solve the problem, why are you doing it?
* E.g. intricate solution for insignificant subpopulation isn't really solving the problem, it's tinkering
* Separate tack - X was an issue, so we did Y to solve/circumvent it
</aside>

## Keep it simple (stupid)

![kiss](www/kiss.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
* Assuming we need "an algorithm" or "analytics"
* Can you solve the problem by counting and sorting? Do that.
* Does a simple model (e.g. linear/logistic regression) do as well as a complex one? Use it.
* 
</aside>

# Managing complexity

## Ask questions

![questions](www/questions-largest.gif)

## Write it down

![notes](www/notes.gif)

## Track, track, track

![tracks](www/tracks.gif)

## Version control

![flow](www/git-flow.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Manual VC = acceptable in a pinch, but
* Lots of tools for this
* Provides confidence
</aside>

## Automate it 

![auto](www/automation.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Prefer code to manual/graphical methods
* Even (e.g) downloading some data - can do manually, but a script is better
* Don't need all automation up-front
    * Even just note down your steps as you go, semi-automates it for next time
    * Eventually can add snippets for each step
    * Finally roll up in to a solution
</aside>

## Bucket and move on

![bucket](www/bucket.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Bucket = subpopulation, sub-task, sub-anything
* Size the bucket, determine if action required, proceed
* Weird set of records? 
    * How many? 
    * Potential impact?
    * Remediating action?
* Complex sub-task?
    * Solves the problem?
    * Effort & duration?
    * Need to proceed?
* Progress to goal - set time bucket, keep improving until time runs out, then stop    
</aside>

# Almost life advice

## Embrace others

## Recognise yourself

> "Stuart Lee is not funny and has nothing to say" - Telegraph [via Stuart Lee show poster]

![presenter](www/larry-presenter.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Saw the quote on an advert, at the time thought it was funny, but it stuck with me
* Everyone I've met has imposter syndrome
* Recognise your achievements/embrace that you don't know everything
* Encouragement - I know (comparatively) very little about a lot of things, but here I am; you can be here too.
</aside>

## Everyday is a school day

Embrace [meta learning](https://edwinth.github.io/meta-learning/)

1. What
2. How
3. Why

<aside class="notes">
* Links to previous topic
* There is always something new to learn in this field
* Define yourself
* Decide what you'll learn, how you will learn it, and why you want to learn it
* Hint: because it fits your definition of who you are/what you do
</aside>

> "Just tell me what to optimise on!" - Hilary Parker, Not So Standard Deviations

<aside class="notes">
* What is the most important metric to your customer?
* If you don't know, ask!
* Make sure your solution addresses that metric
</aside>

## Make a plot

![vader](www/graphs-vader.PNG)

<aside class="notes">
* "A picture tells a thousand words" - duh!
* But pick the right plot - remember, keep it simple
* Lot's of great resources out there, e.g. Truthful Art, Storytelling with Data
* Strip away anything that's not your key message; that doesn't relate to the
thing you were optimising
</aside>


## {data-background="www/perspective.svg"}

<aside class="notes">
* Your model metrics are good
    * You have an AUC of X
    * The MSE is Y
* Your customer probably doesn't care
* Tell them it will:
    * "Generate Y revenue"
    * "Increase [thing] by Z%"
    * "Provide cost reductions of ..."
* Communicate in the language of the problem
    * No one asked you to build a model with X/Y/Z properties
    * They asked you to solve a problem
    * Demonstrate _how_ your solution solves the problem
* Remember - it's just data/work
