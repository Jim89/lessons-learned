![who](www/who.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Started at KPMG in 2012
    * Where I met Enda
* Early career as a data analyst/junior data scientist
* Self study, then MSc Data Science - including a placement at Sains
* Worked on a variety of problems
    * ML, non-ML, calculations, remediations, forensics
* An admission, I won't be talking much about bugs    
* CAUTION: Mostly stupid pictures and gifs
</aside>

# Some basic principles

## Meet your customer

![meeting](www/meeting.png)

<aside class = "notes">
* If you don't know who that is - find out!
* Obviously they're too happy to be in a meeting
* BUT - meeting your customer/end user is crucial
* Ideally face-to-face
* Make it regular, keep them involved
* Solicit feedback early, and often
* Discuss the odd things you see
* Resolve issues
</aside>

## Do some analysis

![analysis](www/analysis.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Helps you to understand the issue, understand the data
* Helps quantify if the issue noteworthy?
* What are the (sub)populations?
* Size your data = size the problem
* Let's you talk about the impact of your work, e.g. affects X customers, Y% of products
</aside>

## {data-background="www/solve-problem.jpg"}

<aside class="notes">
* Focus your efforts on things that solve the customer's problem
* If it's not helping you solve the problem, why are you doing it?
* E.g. intricate solution for insignificant subpopulation isn't really solving the problem, it's tinkering
* Separate tack - X was an issue, so we did Y to solve/circumvent it
    * I.e. solve the problem before you report on it
    * Or at least propose solutions (if you can!)
</aside>

## Keep it simple (stupid)

![kiss](www/kiss.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
* Assuming we need "an algorithm" or "analytics"
* Can you solve the problem by counting and sorting? Do that.
* Does a simple model (e.g. linear/logistic regression) do as well as a complex
one? Use it.
* Does a simple, but less "elegant" bit of code solve your problem - use it,
don't re-write it!
</aside>

# Managing complexity

## Ask questions

![questions](www/questions-largest.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Seems obvious but I've seen questions not be asked and work proceed based on hunches/guesses
* Ask _open_ questions at the start, narrow down later
    * Can you tell me about...
    * What do you see the impact of X as?
    * What outcome(s) would you like to see
* This will help build your understanding of the issue 
* Take note of the answer
* If you find yourself asking the same questions at the start of a project, turn
then in to a resource for you/others in the future!
</aside>

## Write it down

![notes](www/notes.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Helps me to remember things, not necessarily for everyone, but use a technique
* Gives you a reference for later
* Write it for yourself, but also get responses/feedback in writing
    * E.g. initial request, clarifications, sign off
    * Useful to summarise your understanding for a collaborator
    * Especially for dynamic/chaotic projects to CYA
* Write your notes somewhere they can be shared
    * Git[something] issue
    * Wiki page
    * readme
    * Notes on a shared folder
</aside>

## Track, track, track

![tracks](www/tracks.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* If you don't track it, you can't confidently report on it
    * Extension of "Measure what matters"
* Use some sort of referencing system for your work
    * Not "that notebook I sent you last week" (you sent many)
    * But "the notebook from experiment 005"
* Doesn't have to be a complex system for tracking
    * Don't spend more time tracking than you do doing
    * Simple xlsx/csv often suffices
* Lots of tools to help
    * Jira
    * GH Issues
* Gives you confidence that you know where things are, are organised, and have
things under control
</aside>

## Automate it 

![auto](www/automation.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Prefer code to manual/graphical methods
* Even (e.g) downloading some data - can do manually, but a script is better
* Don't need all automation up-front
    * Even just note down your steps as you go, semi-automates it for next time
    * Eventually can add snippets for each step
    * Finally roll up in to a solution
</aside>

## Use version control

![flow](www/git-flow.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Manual VC = acceptable in a pinch
* But if you're writing code, you need a more robust solution
* Lots of tools for this - personal favourite is git
* Integrates doing with organising, recording, and sharing (e.g. with GH)
* Gives you understandable audit trails
* Lots of tools provide features for integrating QA with your work
    * E.g. issues, pull/merge requests
</aside>

## Bucket and move on

![bucket](www/bucket.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Bucket = subpopulation, sub-task, sub-anything
* Size the bucket, determine if action required, proceed
* Weird set of records? 
    * How many? 
    * Potential impact?
    * Remediating action?
* Complex sub-task?
    * Solves the problem?
    * Effort & duration?
    * Need to proceed?
* Model tuning - set time bucket, keep improving until time runs out, then stop    
</aside>

# Almost life advice

## Recognise yourself

> "Stuart Lee is not funny and has nothing to say" - Telegraph [via Stuart Lee show poster]

![presenter](www/larry-presenter.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Important as this field can be tough, there can be a lot of pressure
* Saw the quote on an advert, at the time thought it was funny, but it stuck with me
* Everyone I've met has imposter syndrome
* Recognise your achievements/embrace that you don't know everything
* Encouragement - I know (comparatively) very little about a lot of things, but here I am; you can be here too.
</aside>

## Everyday is a school day

Embrace [meta learning](https://edwinth.github.io/meta-learning/)

1. What
2. How
3. Why

<aside class="notes">
* Links to previous topic
* There is always something new to learn in this field
* Define yourself
* Decide what you'll learn, how you will learn it, and why you want to learn it
* Hint: because it fits your definition of who you are/what you do
</aside>

## Embrace others

![hug](www/hug.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Working with others who are not like you will enhance you
* Other people know things you don't
* You know things they don't
* You can learn from them (great)
* And share your knowledge with them (builds confience)
* An outside perspective is important
    * Spot things you missed
    * Suggest something you didn't think of
</aside>


# Deliver value

## Pick the right metric

> "Just tell me what to optimise on!" - Hilary Parker, Not So Standard Deviations

<aside class="notes">
* (Great podcast)
* What is the most important metric to your customer? 
* What do they _really_ care about?
* If you don't know, ask!
* Make sure your solution addresses that metric
    * Don't solve for X if Y is the real target
</aside>

## Explain your work

![vader](www/graphs-vader.PNG)

<aside class="notes">
* "A picture tells a thousand words" - duh!
* But pick the right plot - remember, keep it simple
* Lot's of great resources out there, e.g. Truthful Art, Storytelling with Data
* Strip away anything that's not your key message; that doesn't relate to the
thing you were optimising
</aside>


## Put it in perspective {data-background="www/perspective.svg"}

<aside class="notes">
* Your model metrics are good
    * You have an AUC of X
    * The MSE is Y
* Your customer probably doesn't care
* Tell them it will:
    * "Generate Y revenue"
    * "Increase [thing] by Z%"
    * "Provide cost reductions of ..."
* Communicate in the language of the problem
    * No one asked you to build a model with X/Y/Z properties
    * They asked you to solve a problem
    * Demonstrate _how_ your solution solves the problem
* Remember - it's just data/work    
</aside>

## Those principles again

1. Meet your customer
2. Do some analysis
3. Keep it simple
